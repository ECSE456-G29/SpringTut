== Create a resource representation class
Now that youâ€™ve set up the project and build system, you can create your web service.

Begin the process by thinking about service interactions.

The service will handle `GET` requests for `/greeting`, optionally with a name parameter in the query string.
The `GET` request should return a `200 OK` response with `JSON` in the body that represents a greeting.
It should look something like this:

....
{
    "id": 1,
    "content": "Hello, World!"
}
....

The `id` field is a unique identifier for the greeting, and `content` is the textual representation of the greeting.

To model the greeting representation, you create a resource representation class.
Provide a plain old java object with fields, constructors, and accessors for the `id` and `content` data:

----
include::{sourcedir}/hello/Greeting.java[]
----

Next you create the resource controller that will serve these greetings.
