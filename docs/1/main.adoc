== Build with Gradle
First you set up a basic build script.

=== Create the directory structure
In a project directory of your choosing, create the following subdirectory structure; for example, with `mkdir -p src/main/java/hello` on *nix systems:

....
src
└── main
    └── java
        └── hello
....

=== Create a Gradle build file
Below is the inital Gradle build file.

build.gradle

include::{rootdir}/build.gradle[]

The Spring Boot gradle plugin provides many convenient features:

* It collects all the jars on the classpath and builds a single, runnable "über-jar", which makes it more convenient to execute and transport your service.
* It searches for the `public static void main()` method to flag as a runnable class.
* It provides a built-in dependency resolver that sets the version number to match Spring Boot dependencies.
You can override any version you wish, but it will default to Boot’s chosen set of versions.
